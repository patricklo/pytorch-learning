Abstract Characterizing phytoplankton distribution and dynamics in the world’s open oceans requires in
situ observations over a broad range of space and time scales. In addition to temperature/salinity measure-
ments, Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) proﬁling ﬂoats are capable of autonomously observing at high-
frequency bio-optical properties such as the chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, a proxy of the chlorophyll a concen-
tration (Chla), the particulate backscattering coefﬁcient (bbp), a proxy of the stock of particulate organic car-
bon, and the light available for photosynthesis. We analyzed an unprecedented BGC-Argo database of more
than 8,500 multivariable proﬁles collected in various oceanic conditions, from subpolar waters to subtropical
gyres. Our objective is to reﬁne previously established Chla versus bbp relationships and gain insights into
the sources of vertical, seasonal, and regional variability in this relationship. Despite some regional, seasonal
and vertical variations, a general covariation occurs at a global scale. We distinguish two main contrasted
situations: (1) concomitant changes in Chla and bbp that correspond to actual variations in phytoplankton
biomass, e.g., in subpolar regimes; (2) a decoupling between the two variables attributed to photoacclima-
tion or changes in the relative abundance of nonalgal particles, e.g., in subtropical regimes. The variability in
the bbp:Chla ratio in the surface layer appears to be essentially inﬂuenced by the type of particles and by
photoacclimation processes. The large BGC-Argo database helps identifying the spatial and temporal scales
at which this ratio is predominantly driven by one or the other of these two factors.
1. Introduction
Our ability to observe the dynamics of phytoplankton biomass and associated carbon ﬂuxes on relevant
space and time scales considerably limits our understanding and prediction skills of the biogeochemical role
of phytoplankton in the carbon biological pump (Honjo et al., 2014; Legendre et al., 2015; Volk & Hoffert,
1985). For example, in situ measurements of primary production and phytoplankton carbon biomass are par-
ticularly challenging and remain scarce, although novel promising techniques have been recently proposed
(Graff et al., 2012, 2015; Riser & Johnson, 2008). To overcome space-time coverage sampling limitations, bio-
optical oceanographers have implemented optical sensors on a variety of in situ or remote platforms, from
research vessels and moorings to ocean color satellites, gliders, and proﬁling ﬂoats, each with speciﬁc com-
plementary space-time observation scales (Claustre et al., 2010; Dickey, 2003). Such platforms enable to mon-
itor bio-optical properties that serve as proxies for major biogeochemical variables. Those include the
concentration of chlorophyll a (Chla) and the particulate backscattering coefﬁcient at 700 nm (hereafter
referred simply as bbp). The chlorophyll a concentration is the most commonly used proxy for the phyto-
plankton carbon biomass (Cullen, 1982; Siegel et al., 2013), although it is well known that the ratio of Chla to
carbon shows large ﬂuctuations driven by a variety of factors such as phytoplankton physiology (Alvarez
et al., 2016; Geider, 1993; Staehr et al., 2002) or community composition (Geider et al., 1997; Halsey & Jones,
2015; MacIntyre et al., 2002). In the absence of mineral particles (i.e., in most open ocean waters), bbp gener-
ally covaries with, and is therefore used as a proxy of, the stock of particulate organic carbon (POC; Bishop,

2009; Loisel et al., 2002; Stramski et al., 1999). However, changes in the nature (composition and size) of
the particle assemblage may cause large variability in the bbp signal and in the POC-to-bbp relationship
(Bishop, 2009; Flory et al., 2004; Gardner et al., 2006; Stramski et al., 2008).
Examining bio-optical relationships, which, for example, link the inherent optical properties of particles such
as absorption or scattering, to Chla, has long been an area of active research in bio-optical oceanography
(Bricaud et al., 1995; Huot & Antoine, 2016; Mitchell, 1992; Mitchell & Holm-Hansen, 1991; Morel et al., 2007;
Organelli et al., 2017a; Smith & Baker, 1978a; Szeto et al., 2011). Among different types of applications, bio-
optical relationships enable deriving biogeochemical information over a broad range of space and time
scales from in situ or remote optical measurements (Huot et al., 2007; Loisel et al., 2002; Siegel et al., 2005).
Such relationships are also used in semianalytical inverse models to interpret remote sensing ocean color
data (Gordon et al., 1988; Loisel & Morel, 1998; Morel & Maritorena, 2001). Various studies focused on the
relationship between Chla and bbp using data from ocean color remote sensing (Reynolds et al., 2001;
Stramska et al., 2003), ﬁeld cruises (Dall’Olmo et al., 2009; Huot et al., 2008), ﬁxed mooring (Antoine et al.,
2011), or Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) proﬁling ﬂoats (Xing et al., 2014). All of these studies conﬁrmed
the principle of the ‘‘bio-optical assumption’’ (Siegel et al., 2005; Smith & Baker, 1978b), suggesting that in
open ocean waters the optical properties of a water mass covary to a ﬁrst order with Chla. Yet depending
on the considered data set, previous studies also indicate large second-order variability around the mean
bbp versus Chla power law relationship (Brown et al., 2008; Huot et al., 2008; Xing et al., 2014). Restricted to
a given period of time, region, or trophic regime and mainly to the surface layer of the water column, these
studies did not lead to a thorough characterization of the variability in the relationship between Chla and
bbp over the full range of environments encountered in the open ocean. In addition, these studies involved
different methodologies for bbp measurements or retrievals, so that it is difﬁcult to untangle regional and/or
seasonal variability from possible methodological biases (Sullivan et al., 2013).
The recently launched network of BGC-Argo proﬁling ﬂoats is progressively transforming our capability to
observe optical properties and biogeochemical processes in the oceans (Biogeochemical-Argo Planning
Group, 2016; Claustre et al., 2010; IOCCG, 2011; Johnson & Claustre, 2016). The current BGC-Argo bio-optical
database has drastically increased over recent years and now encompasses observations collected in a broad
range of hydrological, trophic, and bio-optical conditions encountered in the world’s open oceans (Organelli
et al., 2017a, 2017b). Based on homogeneous measurements and processing methodologies, this database
offers a unique opportunity to comprehensively reassess bio-optical relationships. Based on the analysis of
more than 8,500 multivariable proﬁles collected within the water column (0–1,000 m) by BGC-Argo ﬂoats,
this study aims to (i) investigate the natural variability around the mean statistical bbp-to-Chla relationship at
the vertical, regional, and seasonal scales and (ii) identify the underlying sources of variability.
2. Data and Methods
2.1. BGC-Argo Profiling Floats
2.1.1. BGC-Argo Database
An array of 105 BGC-Argo proﬁling ﬂoats was deployed in several areas of the world’s oceans in the frame
of several research programs (Organelli et al., 2016a, 2017a). BGC-Argo proﬁling ﬂoat real-time data are
accessible online (at ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/argo/dac/coriolis/), distributed as netCDF data ﬁles (Wong
et al., 2013), and updated daily with new proﬁles. The quality-controlled database of bio-optical vertical pro-
ﬁles that supports this work is publicly available from SEANOE (SEA scieNtiﬁc Open data Edition) publisher
(Barbieux et al., 2017). In this database, proﬁles of bbp were eliminated when bathymetry was shallower
than 400 m and a signature of bbp at depth was noticeable. This allowed us to remove the data collected in
waters where a coastal inﬂuence was suspected, Black Sea excepted. Hence, 8908 BGC-Argo multiparameter
proﬁles or ‘‘stations’’ (corresponding to 91 different BGC-ﬂoats) collected between 8 November 2012 and 5
January 2016 were used in this study. These stations were grouped into 24 geographic areas (Table 1), fol-
lowing the bioregions presented in Organelli et al. (2017a), except for the Eastern Subtropical Atlantic Gyre
that is missing in our database because of suspicious backscattering data from the two proﬁling ﬂoats
deployed in this bioregion.
Our database includes measurements from a wide range of oceanic conditions, from subpolar to tropical
waters and from eutrophic to oligotrophic conditions (Figure 1). For the purpose of simplifying the

presentation of the results, we grouped the different bioregions into ﬁve main regimes: (1) the North Atlan-
tic Subpolar Gyre (NSPG) divided in Icelandic Basin, Labrador and Irminger Seas; (2) the Southern Ocean
(SO) essentially comprising the Indian and the Atlantic sectors; (3) the Mediterranean Sea (MED) that com-
prises the Northwestern Basin (NW_MED), the Southwestern Basin (SW_MED), the Tyrrhenian Sea
(TYR_MED), the Ionian Sea (ION_MED), and the Levantine Sea (LEV_MED); (4) the subtropical regimes (STG)
that include subtropical oligotrophic waters from the North and South Atlantic and Paciﬁc Oceans and Red
Sea (RED_SEA); and (5) the Black Sea (Table 1).
2.1.2. Biogeochemical-Argo Sensor Characteristics and Sampling Strategy
The ‘‘PROVOR CTS-4’’ (NKE Marine Electronics Inc., France) is a proﬁling autonomous platform speciﬁcally
designed in the context of the Remotely Sensed Biogeochemical Cycles in the Ocean (remOcean) and Novel
Argo Ocean Observing System (NAOS) projects. The PROVOR CTS-4 proﬁling ﬂoats used in this study were
equipped with a SBE 41 CTD (Seabird Inc., USA), an OCR-504 (SAtlantic Inc., USA) multispectral radiometer
measuring the Photosynthetically Available Radiation over the 400–700 nm range (PAR), and an ECO3
(Combined Three Channel Sensors; WET Labs, Inc., USA) measuring the ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a and
Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 470/695 and 370/460 nm
respectively, and the angular scattering coefﬁcient of particles (b(h, k)) measured at 700 nm and an angle of
1248. Measurements were collected during upward casts programmed every 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 days depending
on the mission and scientiﬁc objectives. All casts started from the parking depth at 1,000 m at a time that
was sufﬁcient for surfacing around local noon. Vertical resolution of acquisition was 10 m between 1,000
and 250 m, 1 m between 250 and 10 m, and 0.2 m between 10 m and the surface. Raw data (electronic
counts) were transmitted to land, each time the ﬂoats surfaced, through Iridium two-way communication,
and were converted into desired quantities. Each variable was quality-controlled according to procedures
described hereafter and speciﬁcally developed for BGC-Argo data (Organelli et al., 2016b; Schmechtig et al.,

drift.
2.2. Bio-Optical Data Processing
2.2.1. Chlorophyll a Concentration
After dark counts have been subtracted from the raw signal, chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence was ﬁrst converted
into chlorophyll a concentration according to calibration coefﬁcients provided by the manufacturer (WET
Labs, 2016). Following the procedures described in Schmechtig et al. (2014), the real-time dedicated quality
control procedure identiﬁed the occurrence of negative spikes, adjusted chlorophyll a concentration pro-
ﬁles for cases of nonzero values at depth and veriﬁed the range of measured values according to technical
speciﬁcations provided by the manufacturer (WET Labs, 2016). In order to correct for the effect of the so-
called nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ; decrease in the ﬂuorescence-to-Chl a ratio under high light con-
ditions; Kiefer et al., 1973), we systematically applied the procedure developed by Xing et al. (2012). Besides,
in some bioregions such as subtropical gyres or the Black Sea, the chlorophyll a concentration appeared to
increase at depth where it should be null. Proctor and Roesler (2010) assigned this behavior to the inﬂuence
of ﬂuorescence originating from nonalgal matter. Proﬁles were thus corrected according to Xing et al.
(2016). Finally, following the recommendation by Roesler et al. (2017) for Chla measurements from WET
Labs ECO ﬂuorometers, the calibrated quality-controlled Chla values were divided by a correction factor of 2.
The correction factor was deducted from a global comparison of paired HPLC (high-performance liquid
chromatography) and in situ ﬂuorescence Chla data and conﬁrmed by optical proxies of Chla such as light
absorption line height (Roesler & Barnard, 2013) or in situ radiometry (Xing et al., 2011). The regional vari-
ability of this average correction factor along with its possible uncertainties is fully discussed in Roesler
et al. (2017). We performed a sensitivity analysis of the bbp-to-Chla relationship to the factor used for cor-
recting the ﬂuorescence-based Chla values. We tested the inﬂuence of using two sets of regional factors
proposed by Roesler et al. (2017) derived either from HPLC analyses or radiometric measurements, com-
pared to the global factor of 2. Except for the Southern Ocean that appears more sensitive than other
regions to the choice of the correction factor, our analysis reveals that the regional factors induce minor
changes to the bbp-to-Chla relationship. Overall, those minor changes have little impact on the

interpretation of our results. Thereafter our analysis considers Chla values originating from the global cor-
rection factor. Details of the sensitivity analysis may be found in electronic supporting information A.
2.2.2. Particulate Backscattering Coefficient
We followed the procedure established by Schmechtig et al. (2016). Backscattering sensors implemented
on ﬂoats provide the angular scattering coefﬁcient b at 1248 and at 700 nm. The particulate backscattering
coefﬁcient was calculated following Boss and Pegau (2001):
bbpð700Þ ðm21Þ5vð124Þ32p3fbð124; 700Þ–bswð124; 700Þg
(1)
with b(124,700) (m21 sr21) 5 slope 3 (counts – bbdark)
where the (instrument-speciﬁc) slope and bbdark are provided by the manufacturer, and v(124) is equal to
1.076 (Sullivan et al., 2013). The contribution of pure seawater (bsw) was removed and computed according
to Zhang et al. (2009). Finally, vertical proﬁles were quality-controlled by verifying the range of measured
values according to the technical speciﬁcations provided by the manufacturer (WET Labs, 2016) and remov-
ing negative spikes following Briggs et al. (2011). Remaining spikes were removed by applying a median ﬁl-
ter (ﬁve-point window).
2.2.3. Estimation of Uncertainty in the bbp-to-Chla Ratio
The backscattering and chlorophyll ﬂuorescence sensors implemented on ﬂoats are all ECO3 sensors (WET
Labs, Inc.). This avoids heterogeneous sources of uncertainties associated with various sensors (see e.g., Roes-
ler et al., 2017). In addition, the data are calibrated and qualiﬁed following the recommended standard BGC-
Argo procedure presented in Schmechtig et al. (2016). A thorough estimation of the uncertainties affecting
the different parameters would necessitate an entirely dedicated study, which is beyond the scope of the pre-
sent one. However, an estimation of the average error that may inﬂuence our results has been made.

With cor (bbp, Chla) corresponding to the correlation between the particulate backscattering coefﬁcient and
the chlorophyll a. Considering the surface data, a median error of 0.11% is obtained and 80% of the data
show relative errors lower than 10% (Figure 2a). Relative errors larger than 10% appear for the lowest values
of bbp (<1023 m21) and Chla (<1022 mg m23; Figure 2b), which corresponds to the clearest waters of the
oligotrophic gyres. In addition, a sensitivity analysis described in supporting information A indicates that
correcting the ﬂuorescence-based Chla values of the database with regional factors compared to a global
factor does not signiﬁcantly affect the distribution of the computed errors in the bbp-to-Chla ratio.
2.3. Derived Variables
2.3.1. Physical and Biogeochemical Layers of the Water Column
We consider four different layers of the water column: (i) the productive layer (Morel & Berthon, 1989) com-
prised between the surface and 1.5 Zeu, with Zeu corresponding to the euphotic depth which is the depth at
which PAR is reduced to 1% of its surface value; (ii) the mixed layer where all properties are expected to be
homogenous and that encompasses a large fraction of the phytoplankton biomass (Brainerd & Gregg, 1995;
Taylor & Ferrari, 2010); (iii) the surface layer, observable by satellite remote sensing, extending from surface
to the ﬁrst optical depth (Zpd; Gordon & McCluney, 1975); and (iv) the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM)
layer (i.e., thickness of the DCM) where different processes may lead to a Chla enhancement. Unlike the pro-
ductive layer, the surface, the mixed and the deep chlorophyll maximum layers are considered as homoge-
neous layers where the phytoplankton population is expected to be acclimated to the same light and
nutrient regimes. The 0–1.5Zeu layer is chosen to estimate the average bbp-to-Chla ratio in the entire
enlightened layer of the water column, even if it is acknowledged that large variations in this ratio may
occur throughout this layer. This average bbp-to-Chla ratio is thereafter used as a reference to which we
compare the ratios calculated for the other layers of the water column.

The mixed layer depth (MLD) was determined using a 0.03 kg m23 density criterion (de Boyer Montegut,
2004). The euphotic depth Zeu and the penetration depth, Zpd 5 Zeu/4.6, were computed from the BGC-
Argo PAR vertical proﬁles following the procedure described in Organelli et al. (2016b). Values of Zeu and
Zpd are available from Organelli et al. (2016a). To study more speciﬁcally the dynamics of the bio-optical
properties in the DCM layer and because the width of a DCM may ﬂuctuate in space and time, we
adjusted a Gaussian proﬁle to each vertical proﬁle of Chla of the database that presented a deep Chla
maximum and computed the width of this DCM. This parameterizing approach proposed by Lewis et al.
(1983) has been widely used to ﬁt vertical proﬁles of Chla (e.g., Morel & Berthon, 1989; Uitz et al., 2006)
such as

where c(z) is the Chla concentration at depth z, cmax is the Chla concentration at the depth of the DCM
(zmax), and Dz, the unknown, is the width of the DCM.
In order to retrieve Dz, the unknown parameter, we performed an optimization of equation (3) with a maxi-
mum width set at 50 m so only the proﬁles with a relatively pronounced DCM are kept. Then we computed
the mean Chla and bbp for the layer that represents the thickness of the DCM.

(d) mixed layer depth (MLD). Note that the bioregions are ordered following the absolute value of the latitude and, within the Mediterranean Sea, following the
longitude (i.e., from west to east). Red points beyond the end of the whiskers represent outliers beyond the 1.5 3 IQR (IQR 5 interquartile range) threshold.

Finally, all quality-controlled proﬁles of Chla and particulate backscattering coefﬁcient were averaged within
the different considered layers.
2.3.2. Environmental and Biological Parameters
In order to analyze the variability in the bbp-to-Chla relationship, we consider the role of the light condi-
tions in the various layers of the water column, i.e., the productive, mixed, surface, and DCM layers. The
vertical proﬁles of bbp:Chla and PAR were averaged within each of the four considered layers. For each
layer and both variables, the median value was computed monthly and regionally (i.e., for each regime).
For each layer and each regime, we determined the maximum observed PAR that was used to normalize
the monthly median PAR values of the corresponding layer and regime (PARnorm). Ultimately, for each
layer and each regime, the monthly median PARnorm values were classiﬁed into four different intervals (0–
0.25; 0.25–0.50; 0.50–0.75; 0.75–1), and the monthly averaged bbp: Chla values were assigned to one of
these four PARnorm intervals.
Using the method of Uitz et al. (2006), an index of the phytoplankton community composition, based on
the relative contributions of size classes to total chlorophyll a, was also computed from the surface Chla val-
ues. We applied this procedure to the surface Chla values from our BGC-Argo database that we further
monthly averaged to ﬁnally obtain the relative contributions of microphytoplankton to the total chlorophyll
a biomass for each bioregion within the 0-Zpd layer.
3. Results
3.1. Overview of the BGC-Argo Database
A latitudinal decreasing gradient of surface Chla is observed from the North Subpolar Gyre (NSPG) and
Southern Ocean (SO) regimes to the subtropical (STG) regime with a median Chla from 1 mg m23 to
0.05 mg m23, respectively (Figure 2a). It is noteworthy that, in our data set where the South East Paciﬁc
Ocean is not represented, the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (SASTG) is the most oligotrophic bioregion,
experiencing the lowest median Chla (0.014 mg m23) and the highest median Zeu (135 m). A west-to-east
trophic gradient is observed in the Mediterranean Sea, with median surface Chla values of 0.186 and 0.025
mg m23 in the Northwestern Basin and the Levantine Sea, respectively (Figure 2a).
A similar pattern is observed in the surface particulate backscattering coefﬁcient values (Figure 2b). Median
surface bbp values range between 0.002 m21 in NSPG and 0.0003 m21 in STG regime. In the Mediterra-
nean Sea, the bbp values vary over 1 order of magnitude, with maximum values found in the Northwestern
Basin and minimum values in the Levantine Sea. The North Atlantic Transition Zone to Subtropical Equato-
rial Atlantic (EQNASTZ) bioregion exhibits particularly high values of bbp compared to other STG regions
(Figure 2a). The Zeu values also show a latitudinal gradient (Figure 2c), with median values of 50 m in
NSPG and 125 m in STG regimes. The median MLD shows a signiﬁcant variability among the 24 bioregions
(Figure 2d). The distribution of the MLD in the Mediterranean Sea is centered on a low median value of
23 m, but very large values (>250 m) are episodically observed in the Northwestern Mediterranean
(NW_MED). The deepest mixed layers (median value of 98 m) are observed in the South Labrador Sea
(SLAS_NASPG), and episodes of extremely deep mixed layers (1,000 m) are also recorded in the Labrador
Sea (LAS_NASPG). The shallowest mixed layers are observed in the Black Sea (20 m). It is also worth to
notice that MLD values in STG are particularly stable and feature very few outliers.
3.2. Variability in the bbp-to-Chla Relationship at the Global Scale
Within Distinct Layers of the Water Column
3.2.1. The Productive Layer
In this layer, the bbp-to-Chla relationship follows a power law (R2 5 0.74; Figure 3a). Yet when data from dif-
ferent regimes and bioregions are considered separately, regional and seasonal patterns emerge. Bioregions
of the subpolar NSPG and SO regimes (Figures 4a–4i) show a signiﬁcant correlation between Chla and bbp
with high R2 (>0.60) and slope (i.e., exponent of the power law) always above 0.50 (except for the Norwe-
gian Sea, Figure 4a). Minimal values of both Chla and bbp are encountered in winter whereas maximal val-
ues are reached in summer. Deviations from the global log-log linear model occur in some bioregions of
the NSPG regime, e.g., in the Icelandic Basin (ICB_NASPG) in summer (Figure 4b) and are characterized by
an abnormally high bbp signal considering the observed Chla levels. Such a deviation is found all year long
in the Black Sea, where a correlation between Chla and bbp is no longer observable (R2 5 0.09; Figure 4x).

In the Mediterranean Sea, the slope and R2 decrease from the Northwestern Basin (NW_MED, Figure 4j) to
the Levantine Sea (LEV_MED, Figure 4n), where Chla appears to be decoupled from bbp. In the Mediterra-
nean Sea, a seasonal pattern is noticeable principally in the NW_MED, where the highest values of Chla and
bbp are found in spring. Except for the South Atlantic Subtropical Transition Zone (SASTZ) that displays a
steep slope and a high R2 value (0.68 and 0.80, respectively), regions from the subtropical regime do not
show any signiﬁcant correlation between Chla and bbp, featuring the lowest slope and R2 values of the bbp-
to-Chla relationship (Figures 4o–4w). This clearly suggests a decoupling between those two properties. In
these oligotrophic environments, different production regimes are delineated along the vertical axis in the
upper and lower part of the euphotic zone. One may expect that the bbp-to-Chla relationship will vary
depending on the considered layer. In this perspective, we further investigate the behavior of the bio-
optical properties in different layers of the water column, namely the mixed layer, the surface layer, and the
DCM layer.
3.2.2. The Mixed and Surface Layers
The distribution of Chla and bbp data for the surface and mixed layers shows similar patterns (Figures 3b
and 3c). The distribution in the surface layer shows two distinct trends. With the exception of the Atlantic to
Indian Southern Ocean (ATOI_SO) bioregion that shows an important dispersion of bbp values during sum-
mer, the data collected in the NSPG and SO regimes and NW_MED bioregions exhibit a clear log-log linear
covariation between Chla and bbp associated with slopes above 0.3 and high R2 (Figures 5a–5j), similarly to
what is observed for the productive layer (Figures 3a and 4). In the subpolar NSPG and SO regimes, values
of bbp and Chla in the 0-Zpd layer reach their maximal values in summer (Figures 5a–5i), whereas in the
NW_MED, the highest values are recorded in spring (Figure 5j). Data from the subtropical regime (STG) form
a separate cluster where Chla and bbp are decoupled, with generally very low R2 values. Chla values

encountered are almost always under 0.1 mg m23 and the slope of the relationship remains under 0.2.
Whereas bbp values remain constant all over the seasons, a seasonal increase of Chla is observable with
noticeable higher winter values (Figures 5o–5w).
The MED Sea is characterized by a gradual decrease in the Chla and bbp covariation across a longitudinal
trophic gradient (Figures 5j–5n) from the NW_MED (slope 5 0.33, R2 5 0.66) to the LEV_MED (slope 5 0.15,
R2 5 0.21). The Eastern Mediterranean basin does not feature any spring maximum in Chla and bbp (Figures
5m and 5n). However, there is a noticeable winter increase in Chla as reported also in the STG regime.
Regarding the Black Sea bioregion, high values of both variables are observed and no seasonal pattern is
noticed (Figure 5x), consistent with what is observed in the productive layer.

3.2.3. The Deep Chlorophyll Maximum Layer
The analysis of the bbp-to-Chla relationship at the level of the DCM obviously considers only the seasonal or
permanent stratiﬁed regimes (and bioregions) where a DCM occurs, i.e., the Mediterranean and subtropical
regimes. The bbp-to-Chla relationship in the DCM layer gradually deviates from the relationship established
in the productive layer considering all bioregions (Figure 3d). Chla is systematically higher by a factor 2

plot, the black line represents the average relationship calculated for the surface layer (0-Zpd) for the entire database while

regardless of the bioregion and never reaches values below 0.1 mg m23 (Figures 3d and B1 in electronic
supporting information B).
The subset of data from this layer also shows two distinct trends in the bbp-to-Chla relationship, for Chla val-
ues below or above 0.3 mg m23 (Figure 3d). For Chla > 0.3 mg m23, a positive correlation between bbp and
Chla can be noticed, although with a large dispersion of the data around the regression line, whereas for
Chla < 0.3 mg m23, Chla and bbp exhibit a strong decoupling. The MED Sea (Figures B1a–B1e in electronic
supporting information B) is characterized by a stronger covariation between Chla and bbp than the STG
regime (Figures B1f–B1n in electronic supporting information B) (R2 5 0.53 for NW_MED versus R2 5 0.10 for
SPSTG). In the Mediterranean Sea, DCMs are seasonal phenomena occurring essentially in summer or fall
(e.g., Siokou-Frangou et al., 2010). A covariation between bbp and Chla occurs as soon as a DCM takes place,
with maximum values of bbp and Chla encountered in summer when the DCM is the most pronounced, in
both the western and eastern Mediterranean basins. On the opposite, in the STG regime where durable
stratiﬁcation takes place, DCMs appear as a permanent pattern. The bbp and Chla variations are decoupled
and the highest values of both variables are recorded in spring or fall.
4. Discussion
The present analysis of a global BGC-Argo database indicates a general power relationship between bbp
and Chla in the productive layer as well as in the surface and mixed layers. Nevertheless, the analysis of sub-
sets of data suggests a large second-order variability around the global mean relationships, depending on
the considered range of values in Chla and bbp, layer of the water column, region, or season. In this section,
we investigate the sources of variability around the average bbp-to-Chla relationship in our database.
4.1. General Relationship Between Chla and bbp
The chlorophyll a concentration is the most commonly used proxy for the phytoplankton carbon biomass
(Cullen, 1982; Siegel et al., 2013), whereas the particulate backscattering coefﬁcient is considered as a proxy
of the POC in open ocean (Balch et al., 2001; Cetinic´ et al., 2012; Dall’Olmo & Mork, 2014; Stramski et al.,
1999) and provides information on the whole pool of particles, not speciﬁcally on phototrophic organisms.
Over broad biomass gradients, the stock of POC covaries with phytoplankton biomass and hence bbp and
Chla show substantial covariation. This is what is observed in the present study when the full database is
considered (Figure 3a). This is also the case when we examine subsets of data from the NSPG and SO
regimes that feature strong seasonality and show relatively constant relationships between bbp and Chla
(Figures 3a–3c, 4a–4I, and 5a–5i). In such environments, an increase in the concentration of chlorophyll a is
associated with an increase in bbp. Such signiﬁcant relationships between bbp and Chla have indeed been
reported in several studies based on relatively large data sets (Huot et al., 2008) or measurements from
seasonally dynamic systems (Antoine et al., 2011; Stramska et al., 2003; Xing et al., 2014). Our results
corroborate these studies and yield a global relationship of the form bbp(700) 5 0.00181 (60.000001)
Chla0.605 (60.005) for the productive layer.
Nevertheless, the bbp-to-Chla relationship is largely variable depending on the considered layer of the water
column. Regarding the mixed and surface layers, our study suggests a general relationship with determina-
tion coefﬁcients smaller than those calculated for the productive layer. The intercept (0.0017) and more
importantly the slope values (0.36) associated with the surface layer are also lower than those associated
with the productive layer (Table 3); hence, for a given level of bbp, the Chla is lower for the surface layer
than predicted by the productive layer relationship. Empirical relationships of the literature previously
established in various regions in the ﬁrst few meters of the water column (Antoine et al., 2011; Dall’Olmo
et al., 2009; Reynolds et al., 2001; Xing et al., 2014) always show steeper slope compared to our results for
the surface layer (Table 2).
To our knowledge, the present study proposes the ﬁrst analysis of the bbp-to-Chla relationship within the
DCM layer. A signiﬁcant relationship between bbp and Chla is observed and it is associated with the steep-
est slope, the highest RMSE and the lowest coefﬁcient of determination in comparison with the other layers
(Table 3). Thus, for the DCM layer, a given level of bbp is associated with higher values of Chla than pre-
dicted by the global relationship of the productive layer.

In the next two sections, we will investigate the underlying processes leading to the existence or not of a
relationship between bbp and Chla and explore the variability of this relationship along the vertical dimen-
sion, the seasons and the distinct bioregions of the different regimes. For this purpose, we will consider the
behavior of the bbp:Chla ratio with respect to light conditions and phytoplankton community composition.
4.2. Influence of the Nature of the Particulate Assemblage on the bbp-to-Chla Relationship
Although the relationship between POC and bbp is evident in some regions, the particulate backscattering
coefﬁcient is not a direct proxy of POC. It depends on several parameters such as the concentration of par-
ticles in the water column, their size distribution, shape, structure, and refractive index (Babin & Morel,
2003; Huot et al., 2007; Morel & Bricaud, 1986; Whitmire et al., 2010). The bbp coefﬁcient has been shown to
be very sensitive to the presence of picophytoplankton as well as of nonalgal particles of the submicron
size range (e.g., detritus, bacteria, and viruses), especially in oligotrophic waters (Ahn et al., 1992; Stramski
et al., 2001; Vaillancourt et al., 2004), but also to particles up to 10 mm (Loisel et al., 2007).
In regions with substantial inputs of mineral particles, a shift toward enhanced bbp values for a constant
Chla level occurs (Figures 4w and 4x, 5w and 5x). Substantial concentrations of mineral particles, submi-
crometer particles of Saharan origin, for example, have been shown to cause signiﬁcant increases in the par-
ticulate backscattering signal (Claustre et al., 2002; Loisel et al., 2011; Prospero, 1996; Stramski et al., 2004).
The EQNASTZ bioregion exhibits, for example, particularly high bbp values compared to the low Chla found
in the surface layer (Figures 4w and 5w). This is not surprising considering that this region is located in the
Equatorial North Atlantic dust belt (Kaufman et al., 2005). The Black Sea is also characterized by a higher bbp
signal than predicted from Chla based on our global model (Figures 4x and 5x). This could be explained by
the fact that this enclosed sea follows a coastal trophic regime and is strongly inﬂuenced by river runoff
that may carry small and highly refractive lithogenic particles (Ludwig et al., 2009; Tanhua et al., 2013). Such
an increase in backscattering signal may also be related to coccolithophorid blooms (Balch et al., 1996a).
These small calcifying microalgae highly backscatter light due to their calcium carbonate shell and their
presence could explain the episodically higher bbp than predicted by the global regression model

particularly in the Black Sea where coccolithophorid blooms are frequently reported (Cokacar et al., 2001;
Kopelevich et al., 2014) or in the Iceland Basin (Balch et al., 1996b; Holligan et al., 1993; Figure 4b or 5b).
Recently, the bbp:Chla ratio, proxy of the POC:Chla ratio (Alvarez et al., 2016; Behrenfeld et al., 2015; West-
berry et al., 2016), has been used as an optical index of phytoplankton communities, with low values associ-
ated with a dominance of diatoms in the phytoplankton assemblage (Cetinic´ et al., 2012, 2015). Indeed, in
open ocean waters, phytoplankton generally dominate the pool of particles in the water column. A shift
toward higher or weaker bbp values at a constant Chla level may be explained by changes in the phyto-
plankton community composition. However, in oligotrophic environments, nonalgal particles may represent
a signiﬁcant part of the particulate assemblage (Loisel et al., 2007; Stramski et al., 2004; Yentsch & Phinney,
1989). Indeed, a background of submicronic living biological cells such as viruses and bacteria or even non-
living particles including detritus or inorganic particles could inﬂuence the bbp:Chla ratio (e.g., Claustre
et al., 1999; Morel & Ahn, 1991; Stramski et al., 2001).
The lowest bbp:Chla values in our global database occur in summer in the NSPG and SO regimes (Figures
6a–6i) and are associated with large contributions (>40%) of microphytoplankton to the total Chla. This
actually corroborates the hypothesis of Cetinic´ et al. (2012, 2015) that bbp:Chla can be considered as an opti-
cal index of the phytoplankton community composition. High values of the bbp:Chla ratio are associated
with large contributions of picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton to algal biomass and low values
with diatom-dominated communities. The occurrence of microphytoplankton blooms of large-sized

phytoplankton community is indeed well known in the NSPG regime (Barton et al., 2015; Cetinic´ et al., 2015;
Li, 2002) or in some productive regions of the Southern Ocean (Georges et al., 2014; Mendes et al., 2015;
Uitz et al., 2009). Similarly, in the NW_MED bioregion, low bbp:Chla values are accompanied by large contri-
butions of microphytoplankton during the spring bloom (Marty & Chiaverini, 2010; Mayot et al., 2016;
Siokou-Frangou et al., 2010). On the opposite, high bbp:Chla values in summer are rather associated with
dominant contributions of the picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton to the total chlorophyll biomass
(Figure 6j) and also possibly to a higher proportion of nonalgal particles, consistently with Navarro et al.
(2014) or Sammartino et al. (2015).
In the rest of the Mediterranean Basin (SW_MED, TYR_MED and the Eastern Basin) (Figures 6k–6n) as well as
in the subtropical regime, the phytoplankton biomass is essentially constant throughout the year with high
bbp:Chla values in summer, lower values in winter, and a relatively constant picoplankton-dominated algal
community (Figures 6o–6w; Dandonneau et al., 2004; Ras et al., 2008; Uitz et al., 2006). In this region, the
seasonal cycle of the bbp:Chla ratio does not seem to be inﬂuenced at a ﬁrst order by changes in phyto-
plankton community composition.
4.3. Influence of Photoacclimation on the bbp-to-Chla Relationship
The Chla is an imperfect proxy of phytoplankton biomass that varies not only with phytoplankton carbon
biomass but also with environmental conditions such as light, temperature, or nutrient availability (Babin
et al., 1996; Cleveland et al., 1989; Geider et al., 1997). Phytoplankton cells adjust their intracellular Chla in
response to changes in light conditions through the process of photoacclimation (Dubinsky & Stambler,
2009; Eisner et al., 2003; Falkowski & Laroche, 1991; Lindley et al., 1995). Photoacclimation-induced varia-
tions in intracellular Chla may cause large changes in the Chla-to-carbon ratio (Behrenfeld et al., 2005;
Geider, 1987; Sathyendranath et al., 2009) and, thus, changes in the bbp-to-Chla ratio (Behrenfeld & Boss,
2003; Siegel et al., 2005). In the upper oceanic layer of the water column, photoacclimation to high light
may result in an increase in the bbp-to-Chla ratio whereas a decrease in this ratio occurs in DCM layers or in
the upper layer during winter time in subpolar regimes (NSPG and SO) where photoacclimation to low light
occurs.
The impact of light conditions on the bbp:Chla ratio in the different regimes is illustrated in Figure 7. Signiﬁ-
cant trends are observed in the different layers of the water column for all regimes except for the Black Sea.
In the NSPG and SO regimes, the bbp:Chla ratio remains relatively constant with respect to the normalized
PAR regardless of the considered layer of the water column (Figures 7a–7c). In contrast, the Mediterranean
Sea and the subtropical gyres show a decoupling between bbp and Chla (Figures 5k–5w) so the bbp:Chla
ratio in the productive, mixed or surface layer increases with an increase in the normalized PAR (Figures 7a–
7c). The seasonal cycle of the bbp:Chla ratio in these regimes results from variations in Chla whereas bbp
remains relatively constant over the seasons (not shown). Thus, our results suggest that the variability in the
bbp:Chla ratio in the NSPG and SO regimes is not driven at ﬁrst order by phytoplankton acclimation to light
level even if such a process is known to occur at shorter temporal and spatial scales in those regimes (Beh-
renfeld et al., 2015; Lutz et al., 2003). On the opposite, in both the MED and STG regimes the bbp:Chla ratio
variations are essentially driven by phytoplankton photoacclimation.
In these oligotrophic regimes, Chla within the DCM layer is at least a factor of 2 higher than in the produc-
tive layer (Figure 6). In the lower part of the euphotic zone, phytoplankton cells hence adjust their intracellu-
lar Chla to low light conditions, resulting in a decrease in the bbp:Chla ratio. In addition, the bbp:Chla ratio in
this layer seems to remain constant within a regime regardless of absolute light conditions (Figure 7d).
Actually, the absolute values of PAR essentially vary between 10 and 25 mmol quanta m22 s21 in all the bio-
regions along the year with values exceeding 50 mmol quanta m22 s21 only in the NW_MED and EQNASTZ
bioregions. As reported by Letelier et al. (2004) and Mignot et al. (2014), the DCM may follow a given iso-
lume along the seasonal cycle and is thus essentially light driven. Finally, we suggest that the relative homo-
geneity of both the environmental (PAR) conditions and phytoplankton community composition at the
DCM level in subtropical regimes may explain the relative stability of the bbp:Chla values in this water col-
umn layer. In the Mediterranean Sea, in contrast, some studies evoke changes in phytoplankton communi-
ties in the DCM layer (Crombet et al., 2011) suggesting our results might be further explored when relevant
data are available.

4.4. Variability in the bbp-to-Chla Relationship Is Driven by a Combination of Factors
In the previous sections, we examined the processes that potentially drive the variability in the bbp-to-Chla
relationship in the various oceanic regimes considered here.
In the subpolar regimes NSPG and SO, changes in the composition of the particle assemblage, phytoplank-
ton communities in particular, are likely the ﬁrst-order driver of the seasonal variability in the bbp-to-Chla
ratio (Figure 8). In these regimes, the bbp:Chla ratio remains constant regardless of the light intensity in
both the productive and surface layers suggesting that phytoplankton photoacclimation is likely not an
important driver of the variability in the bbp-to-Chla relationship. We note, however, that in the SO other
factors may come into play, such as the light-mixing regime or iron limitation (e.g., Blain et al., 2007, 2013;
Boyd, 2002). On the opposite, in the subtropical regime, Chla and bbp are decoupled in the surface layer as
well as in the DCM layer. Thus, photoacclimation seems to be the main process driving the vertical and sea-
sonal variability of the bbp-to-Chla relationship, although a varying contribution of nonalgal particles to the
particle pool cannot be excluded.
Whereas the subpolar and the subtropical regimes behave as a ‘‘biomass regime’’ and a ‘‘photoacclimation
regime’’ (sensu Siegel et al., 2005), respectively, the Mediterranean Sea stands as an intermediate regime
between these two end-members. The large number of data available in the Mediterranean allows us to
describe this intermediate situation (Figure 8). The Mediterranean Sea appears as a more complex and vari-
able system than the stable and resilient subtropical gyres. Along with the ongoing development of the
global BGC-Argo program and associated ﬂoat deployments, additional data collected in underrepresented
regions will become available to make our database more robust and will help to improve our analysis. In
the surface layer of the Mediterranean system, a high bbp:Chla ratio in summer might be attributed not only
to (i) a background of submicronic living biological cells such as viruses and bacteria or large contribution
of nonliving particles including detritus or inorganic particles (Bricaud et al., 2004; Claustre et al., 1999;

Radiation (PARnorm) for each regime within (a) the layer comprised between the surface and 1.5Zeu, (b) the mixed layer,

Oubelkheir et al., 2005) or to (ii) photoacclimation of phytoplankton cells to high light conditions as sug-
gested by Bellacicco et al. (2016), but also to (iii) a shift toward small phytoplankton dominated communi-
ties (picophytoplankton or nanophytoplankton) after the seasonal microphytoplankton bloom.
Following the longitudinal trophic gradient of the Mediterranean Sea, we observe a variation in the biogeo-
chemical status of the DCM (Figures 1a–d in Supporting information A). The DCM may be attributed to low
light photoacclimation similarly to the DCM observed in the STG regime. Yet under favorable light and
nutrient conditions encountered in the Western Mediterranean basin, the DCM could result from a real bio-
mass increase occurring at depth instead of a simple photoacclimation ‘‘artifact’’ (Beckmann & Hense, 2007;
Cullen, 2014; Mignot et al., 2014; Winn et al., 1995). In such conditions referred to as ‘‘deep biomass maxi-
mum’’ (DBM), a concurrent increase in Chla and POC associated with large phytoplankton cells leads to con-
stantly low values of the bbp:Chla ratio (Figure 7d). Our results corroborate previous studies (Crombet et al.,
2011; Latasa et al., 1992; Mignot et al., 2014) about the seasonal occurrence of a DBM in the Western Basin
of Mediterranean Sea. This deep feature could actually represent a signiﬁcant source of phytoplankton car-
bon biomass that is ignored by satellite ocean color sensors that only probe the surface layer of the water
column.

5. Conclusions
The main goal of the present study was to examine the variability of the relationship between the particu-
late backscattering coefﬁcient and the chlorophyll a concentration over a broad range of oceanic condi-
tions. Using an extensive BGC-Argo proﬁling ﬂoat database, we investigated the sources of variability in this
relationship with respect to the vertical dimension as well as on a seasonal and regional scale. In accordance
with previous studies (Antoine et al., 2011; Dall’Olmo et al., 2009; Huot et al., 2008; Reynolds et al., 2001;
Stramska et al., 2003; Xing et al., 2014) and consistently with the so-called ‘‘bio-optical assumption’’ (Siegel
et al., 2005; Smith & Baker, 1978b), a general covariation between bbp and Chla is observed at a global scale
in the productive layer of the water column (0–1.5Zeu). Although this covariation seems to be permanent in
subpolar regimes in relation with large-amplitude phytoplankton biomass seasonal cycles (Boss & Behren-
feld, 2010; Henson et al., 2006; Lacour et al., 2015), several nuances have been revealed according to the
season, considered layer of the water column and bioregion. We suggest that the bbp:Chla ratio, proxy of
the C:Chla ratio (Behrenfeld et al., 2015; Westberry et al., 2016), can be used either as an index of the nature
(composition and size) of the particle assemblage in a ‘‘biomass regime’’ (NSPG and SO regimes and West-
ern Mediterranean basin) or as a photophysiological index in a ‘‘photoacclimation regime’’ (STG regime and
Eastern Mediterranean basin).
The present analysis provides insights into the coupling between major proxies of the POC and phytoplank-
ton biomass in key regimes encountered in the world’s open oceans. It points to the strong potential of the
recently available global BGC-Argo ﬂoat database to address regional or seasonal nuances in ﬁrst-order rela-
tionships that have been established in the past on admittedly restricted data sets. In addition, this study
stresses out the large variability in the bbp-to-Chla relationship, which is critical to the bio-optical modeling
of the bbp coefﬁcient in several semiempirical ocean color models (Garver & Siegel, 1997; Lee et al., 2002;
Maritorena et al., 2002). Indeed, bio-optical and reﬂectance models require detailed knowledge and param-
eterization of the average trends in the inherent optical properties, especially in open ocean waters where
these trends can be related to Chla. Although the analysis of the impact of such variability on ocean color
modeling is out of the scope of the present paper, we expect our analysis to be potentially useful in the
context of applications to ocean color. Finally, as the amount of BGC-ﬂoat data will continue to increase, it
will be possible to reassess the variability of bio-optical relationships and to establish new ‘‘global’’ stand-
ards and regional parameterizations.
